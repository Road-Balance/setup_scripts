## Version Notation 
(momo version).(WebRTC version).(build version)

## How do they differ from each other? 
 Usually, different build version would mean no more than... 
 1. Different version of [momo](https://github.com/shiguredo/momo) 
 2. Different version of WebRTC library build from [Shiguredo](https://github.com/shiguredo/shiguredo-webrtc-build) 
 3. Different build "parity" : changes that can be made in CMakeLists.txt such as toggling USE_JETSON_ENCODER and so on.
